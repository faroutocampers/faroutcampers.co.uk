      <h2>About Far Out Campers</h2>
      <p>Far Out Campers was born out of a love for road trips, nature, and creating comfortable, affordable family getaways. We're a small, independent business converting large panel vans into beautifully designed campersâ€”perfect for families of 3 or 4 who want to explore the UK and Europe.</p>

      <p>Founded by Dan, an anaesthetist and part-time van converter, Far Out Campers is built on care, creativity and a hands-on approach. We focus on practical design, reliable builds, and a warm customer experience. We believe everyone should be able to enjoy the freedom of van life without compromising comfort or safety.</p>

      <p>Whether it's a weekend escape or a two-week road trip, our vans are designed with families in mind: bunk-style beds, off-grid electrics, and smart storage are all part of the package.</p>
